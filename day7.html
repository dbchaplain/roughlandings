		<h3> Rough Landings Day 7: Fighting Stress with Positive Perspective </h3>

		As a college student, I have experienced stress and excruciating effort unparalleled by any other time in my life. One semester was especially overwhelming. A combination of 
		academic overload, sleep deprivation, and extracurricular commitments combined for the perfect mix of physical and emotional exhaustion. At the time, I felt like there was no 
		one else who could possibly be feeling the same weight crushing down on me. I was feeling defeated until a change in my perspective helped me recover from my rough landing and 
		keep on flying. Now, I realize that those feelings are not uncommon- I hope that this story can give hope to a student in a similar situation.

		“Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put 
		us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.” <br> James 5:3-5 (ESV)
		</blockquote> 
		
		<p>
		As finals neared, I was already feeling defeated. Looking back at the last few months, the semester had seemed to have gone downhill from the start; a snowball effect of stress and 
		overwhelming responsibilities. I had a time-consuming position in ROTC with over 100 people depending on me to do my job well. The daily planning and execution of the tasks expected
		of me began to take their toll as the semester dragged on. I had performed poorly on my midterm exams. A low semester GPA could endanger my merit based scholarships- a large part 
		of why it was possible for me to afford a college education. These tasks, combined with other smaller tasks that I will spare the details of, resulted in sleep deprivation. Studying 
		late and waking up early for physical training with ROTC reduced my average hours of rest per night from six to four. I was battling sickness and exhaustion. I felt alone, helpless,
		and destined to fail. Why did my life have to be so difficult? Thankfully, my story does take a turn for the better. The catalyst for change was a positive change in perspective.
		</p> 
		
		<p>
		On an especially difficult night, I took some time to read the Bible, pray, and meditate on how I was doing. I realized that much of my negative feelings had stemmed from forgetting 
		the true reason I was at school. My focus had shifted to living up to the expectations of others; I didn’t want to let others down. If only I could get all my work done, no one would
		be disappointed in me. I remembered that I had come to this place and pushed myself to follow such a difficult degree and challenging path for a reason- to serve and love others. 
		James 5 reminded me that the testing of my faith and strength makes me a stronger person; A stronger person who is more able to love and serve others in a higher capacity than before. 
		I also realized that I did not have to wait until I was done with my work at school to love and serve those around me. I began to view my leadership position in ROTC not as a requirement
		set for me, but as an opportunity to improve the lives of those around me. I started to lighten the spirits of my classmates, and cheer them on in class even while I was still struggling
		with the material. As I remembered my purpose and began to act out of love, my semester began to slowly turn around. I ended the semester with a respectable GPA (by the grace of God). 
		While I was proud of my academic accomplishments, I was most proud of the ways I was able to serve others out of love.
		</p> 
		
		<p> 
		Whenever the going gets rough, I take time to reflect on the real reason I am here. The hope of spreading light and love into the lives of others continues to motivate me. No longer
		do I see college as a struggle to fill the expectations of others. Instead, school has become a way for me to serve and love others. I still struggle and still face a wall of challenges 
		and responsibilities, however, I now face them knowing that the testing of my faith creates perseverance, perseverance creates character, and character creates hope- unstoppable, 
		invincible hope.
