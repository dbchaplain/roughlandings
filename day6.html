		Coming to Riddle and choosing to do Aerospace engineering as my career path is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life. Even though I’m not done with my 
		masters yet and don’t know what the future holds for me, the experience I’ve managed to live through is one I will hold dearly for the rest of my life.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Aerospace engineering, known for its reputation of being one of the difficult majors in the school, is in fact, difficult. During those long, silent nights when the 
		good residents of Daytona Beach were on their way to Dreamland, here we were in the windowless rooms of the engineering building, dull and cold, punching away numbers 
		and solving equations for an object that is expected to fly. It was during these wearing times when one would turn into a philosopher and ask themselves “who am I and 
		what am I doing here?” As humorous as this may sound, these were questions I had to continuously ask myself. To see what path I had set for myself. To what purpose 
		would my drive be engaged towards?
		</p>
		
		<p>
		As a Muslim, two ideas help me go through the brick walls I run into. One verse in the Quran says, “Verily God does not change the condition of a people until they 
		change what is within themselves” (13:11). The meaning I get from this verse is; to change or grow for the better, one has to consistently look back and reflect on 
		their current state. This means going back and evaluating the decisions one’s made or methods one uses to do something. This can be by how they study, their process 
		of learning, or even their mental/psychological approach towards their studies.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		One factor that I’ve realized was critical to my performance in school was the mental attitude I had given a particular subject. For example, since high school I had 
		predetermined for myself that I was never a person for the arts. This included humanities classes. And so the first humanities class I had to take, I accepted whatever 
		came along as long as I passed. But then later on, I met people whose attitude towards the engineering classes were as positive as when they would be in their humanities 
		classes. And so I asked myself, why can’t I be like that? And so I experimented myself in trying to change my attitude to not only my humanities classes, but to anything 
		I was doing. And as a matter of fact, I did start seeing changes in my results. I managed to have boosted my performance in my humanities classes, and my engineering 
		classes as well. And so it was the drive to change myself, to improve, that I started seeing positive results in my life.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		As to the second point, the process of trying to change myself, get through the difficult work that tries to overwhelm us, I think of another part of the Quran that states, 
		“Verily with difficulty comes ease. Definitely with difficulty comes ease” (94:5-6). We’ve always heard, “hard work pays!” Well the emphasis the Quran tries to put on this 
		idea, it first acknowledges the difficulty in our matters, but, it then assures us, it’s all going to be worth it. It tells me, you do your part and persevere through the 
		difficulty, and see God change your state. And hence, relating to the verse stated earlier – the prerequisite of wanting to see your conditions improve – you need to 
		continuously try to improve yourself and to embrace the hard work that comes with it.
