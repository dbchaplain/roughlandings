		<b> Philippians 4:6-8 New King James Version (NKJV): </b> <br>

		“Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all 
		understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever 
		things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things.”
		</p> 
		
		<p>
		This scripture has saved my rough landings on a yearly basis. Every year I come back to school, I realize the contrast of my lax, unstructured summer routine to a scheduled 
		university environment with tests, relationships, and career preparation. This realization sets my mind whirring at the speed of thought and with very real questions about very
		real problems: What am I supposed to do with my life? Where will I find friends? How will I afford this semester? How can I manage this workload? I quickly become steeped in anxiety
		and pressure.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Without fail, some way or another, God gets across to me this message from the scripture above: Be anxious for nothing… Let your requests be made known to God… Whatever is noble…pure… 
		of a good report, meditate on these things.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		That impacts me because, it says to me, and hopefully gives encouragement to you, that yes, our fears, concerns, and anxieties are very real; but there is a higher power that doesn’t
		want you to hide them, but to acknowledge each and every thing that makes us anxious. Then, that higher power calls us to put our cares at His feet, and instead pick up the hopes and 
		outcomes we wish to see. To focus our attention, our musings, and our mind space on all things we consider lovely, pure, noble, of a good report, and anything that we find inspiring.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		If you’re like me, putting down my cares, and picking up peace and hope doesn’t come naturally. After about 12 seconds of meditating on good, my mind shoots back to becoming afraid 
		with how things might devolve or the worst case scenario. But I want to encourage you to decide to not let your mind wander wherever it wants and work against you, but to take the 
		bold step to consider, ponder, and meditate on what you want out of life. Force yourself to only rent out space to your hopes, dreams, desires, and how to attain them.
		</p>

		<p>
		Gandhi said it best, “Your thoughts become your words. Your words become your actions. Your actions become your habits. Your habits become your values. Your values become your destiny.” 
		Soften your rough landing by meditating on what brings you hope.
