		<h3> Rough Landings Day 2: Finding Happiness When... </h3>

		<blockquote> 
		<b> “God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom 
		know the difference” </b>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>
		My freshman year was a whirlwind. I learned a lot and grew the most as a person I ever have. The reason I grew 
		was because life sucked. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		When you already have the best anything else feels like second hand. That’s how college track felt. I took the 
		support system I had developed over four years in high school for granted. It was like I moved out from my parents’ 
		house to a new family and suddenly I was supposed to believe, and trust, and enjoy, and respect, and listen to my 
		new family. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I tried, but I expected to find the track family I had at home and that was not realistic. The relationships I had 
		before weren’t made in a month, some not even a year. They were developed and fortified over time. How could I find 
		happiness when my security was gone? Falsely judging my relationships left me with a sense of unease. That self-doubt 
		festered and led to a downward spiral. 
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		The result was an inner battle. I tried to fit myself into my new family. I tried to be a contributing, helpful family 
		member but I could not keep up. Even with their help I didn’t feel good enough. This feeling translated over many 
		different parts of my life. I broke down. I wanted to give up, to quit. I sort of did. After track ended I didn’t even 
		want to look at a pole. My silver lining had become ugly. My therapy had become my enemy. Pole vault was no longer fun,
		it was work. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		How did I pull out of this downward spiral? I started by taking a break. I thought a lot and sought the wisdom to decide
		if I should quit or continue. After two and a half months of contemplation and unhappiness I decided to practice with my 
		high school coach. It wasn’t until that day that I knew my decision was to stay. I remembered again why I decided to 
		compete at the college level. Being back in the familiar atmosphere, with familiar people allowed me to have fun again. 
		I realized that all the external pressures didn’t matter. I loved my sport and I finally had the wisdom to know what I 
		could change.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I couldn’t change situation, but I could change my attitude. I committed to being happy and having fun. When I made that 
		decision, I found the steady base I needed. I celebrated the differences between my past and present team and while that 
		road was sometimes bumpy it led to where I am now. I look forward to practice again and I’m excited to compete. I’m happy 
		to be doing what I am doing and subsequently I am doing better.   
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Fun seems like such a basic element but it is so crucial for success in anything you do. Find the fun, and happiness will 
		follow. If you can’t, make a change.
