		<b> Pro Life Tip: Don’t Be A Starving Baker <br>
		<i> The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to Him all they had done and taught. Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a 
		chance to eat, he said to them, “Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.” So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. </i> <br>
		Mark 6:29-32 <br> </b>
		</p>
		<p>
		As a freshman, I knew I was going to excel, learn, and do so many things that I would be satisfied. Going into college my faith with God was on point, I was going to be 
		a collegiate pole vaulter, my grades were at the top of my high school class, and my friends were great. I thought I knew how to do this in college as well, but as we all 
		learn, what we “know” changes every day. 
		</p>
		<p>
		During the first couple weeks of school, I found a project where I really thought I could do God’s will. The opportunity seemed too good to pass up, but I soon found out 
		that this project was becoming way more than I intended. Several late nights caused more stress and no results. Track practice helped relieve stress, but it was still 
		physically draining. It took everything I had not to get frustrated, and the emotional effects were showing. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Some friends and family were supportive, but others told me to drop it. I knew that the Holy Spirit was guiding me not to give up. The project was even almost terminated 
		due to some drama at the end of my freshman year. It was an emotionally draining three weeks. 
		</p>
		<p>
		That first summer, I worked for a summer church camp at which I was a previous camper. My campers had already departed during the last night of week 5. It was the worst week 
		of my life due to my seemingly pointless encouragement to others while I just got put down. That night, I cried like there was no tomorrow. A friend noticed, and I was glad 
		to vent to him for 20 minutes, and afterwards, he told me the story of the Starving Baker:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		A town was dying due to the lack of quality food, and a new baker was coming to help. Soon, the baker was happy to see that his bread was healing the people, and he continued 
		to make bread all day and night for the people. The demand kept growing, and the town flourished during this time. However, after the following weeks, the baker’s smile was a 
		little deflated, and he was noticeably thinner. The baker was working so much that he didn’t leave any time to eat or sleep. Sadly, after a month, the baker caught a deadly 
		illness because of his condition. Without any good food, the town also started to get sick again, and everyone had to leave if they weren’t sick already. 
		</blockquote>
		<p>
		This story was meaningful to me because I had been that baker during week 5 and in my project at school. I was weary and emotionally sick. From then on, I started to learn how 
		to have rest in Christ Jesus. I found that spending time in prayer, worship, and word was the absolute best way to stay refreshed and healthy in my mind, body, and spirit. I 
		started learning to not say yes to every responsibility that came my way and to trust that God would lead me to the opportunities I needed. I found many ways to escape with 
		books, video games, sports, and, sometimes, even studies. I learned that God can balance even the most upset scales.
