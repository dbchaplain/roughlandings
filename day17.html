		<h3> Rough Landings Day 17 </h3>
		
		
		<p>
		My biggest struggle was the language barrier, as some people describe it as a second language disability. The second language disability was a barrier in creating friends around the campus.
		I consider friendship as a path to analyze and explore the iceberg of other cultures and religions. Indeed, as a human, it is important to be connected to the people around you. What helped
		me to overcome this obstruction was the Quran. The Quran says in chapter 49, verse 13, “O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another…” This verse was the inspirational source which helped me to realize the importance of creating friendship and overcome the language barrier that I no longer have.

		Another rough landing on campus was not being able to attend my brothers’ wedding. These were the first two important family events that I could not attend during the semester. 
		However, while reading the Quran, I came across chapter 2, verse 216, which says, “But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad 
		for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not.” Eventually, this was another passage from the Quran that assisted me to succeed in dealing with such a situation.
