		<b> Rough Landings Day 5: You are Part of Something Bigger </b> <br>
		Sometimes everything is overwhelming. All of these wonderful students around, amazing faculty, and caring staff. 
		Sometimes I just feel like one of many. Like I'm just a number trying to be statistically significant. Everyone
		around me is smart, and my anxiety eats away at me as I try to remember that I'm smart, too. That I have talents 
		and I am part of something bigger. 
		<blockquote> 
		<i> Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 11 </i> <br>

		Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub; <br>
		It is the center hole that makes it useful. <br>
		Shape clay into a vessel; <br>
		It is the space within that makes it useful. <br>
		Cut doors and windows for a room; <br> 
		It is the holes which make it useful. <br>
		Therefore profit comes from what is there; <br>
		Usefulness from what is not there.
