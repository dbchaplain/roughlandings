		“Comparison is the thief of joy.”  <br>

		<p>
		“Comparison with myself brings improvement, comparison with others brings discontent.” <br>
		- Bettie Jamie Chung

		My struggle at Embry-Riddle has been mostly academic. I am not the smartest person in the world and have a hard time learning the 
		information I need for Aerospace Engineering. Not only is it hard to understand all the information, but I also really struggle with 
		taking tests. Even when I truly know the information the tests don’t turn out well. I just freeze up on and go completely blank. This 
		makes it really hard to pass my tests and classes. I especially struggled with Physics. I believe that the only reason I have made it 
		through is by basically living in the physical sciences department and drilling everything about the material into my head. So even 
		when I do blank, there is still some random information I can write down that could potentially earn me points. After getting multiple 
		test back and continuing to fail, I started to compare myself to classmates that didn’t put as much work into the class and still aced 
		the tests. These comparisons were devastating and took away my motivation to continue in engineering. I was able to take off again when 
		I realized that I need to keep motivation in order to pass my classes. If I lost my motivation I would lose my dream job of designing 
		and innovating planes. Comparing myself to others was truly destroying me in my pursuit to my dream job and realizing this helped me 
		find again the deep motivation I had for academics. I made sure to have trust in God and used lesson plans on comparison using the 
		YouVersion Bible app to keep from comparing myself to others. There are still moments that make me wonder why I am doing this major 
		but what keeps me going is remembering where I want to be with my career, personal happiness and where God wants me to be. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Dear God, <br>
		I want to thank you for allowing me to accomplish as much as I have during the twenty short years of my life. I know that you are always
		watching over me and even during the hard times it’s just small tests to help keep me on track. Allow me to always keep my trust and faith 
		in you and to know that you will be there for me when I fall down. To love you with all of my heart and know that you are always with me. <br>
		Amen
