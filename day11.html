		Coming to Embry-Riddle was one of the most exciting and terrifying experiences for me. I was thrilled to come to college, to meet
		new people, and to learn new things. It also scared me, I hadn’t been away from home for more than a week and now I was moving 
		six-hundred miles away to a place where I didn’t even know anyone. I was embarking on the biggest adventure of my life and it was 
		full of ups and downs. I learned a lot about myself during my first year at ERAU and I grew up, which wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.
		</p>		
		
		<p>
		My first semester at Riddle was rough, I was struggling with my courses and I was constantly homesick. Overcoming the loneliness and 
		homesickness was hard, I came from a very close family that lived in the same town and it was a bit of a culture shock for me to come
		to this new place without any family nearby. As the semester went on I made new friends and that helped take my mind off being homesick.
		I was still struggling with one class and I was constantly studying but I could not figure it out. I had to learn to overcome failure, 
		which was not easy for me to do. I felt like a disappointment because I failed a class. I didn’t know if what I was doing was a good fit 
		for me or if I even needed to be here. I would call home and my parents would encourage me and give me great advice, but it made me miss 
		home more. Looking back, I was fortunate to have parents that supported me the way they did. 
		</p> 
		
		<p>
		Christmas break rolled around and I was so excited to go home. It was a much-needed break from school that allowed me to spend time 
		with my family. They were all so supportive of me and what I was doing, I was excited to go back for my second semester but I wasn’t
		ready to leave home again. I can still remember driving back to Riddle after Christmas break and thinking to myself, “You could turn 
		around now and be home before you would have made it back to Florida.” I prayed more during that drive than I ever have in my life. 
		I prayed for the Lord to give me strength to overcome and conquer this new semester. I prayed that he would heal my heart and guide 
		my steps throughout the year. It was during that drive that I realized I was in Florida for a reason and that God had not given up 
		on me and I couldn’t give up on this. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I realized God had a plan for my life and he placed people around me to support and guide me during this journey. During my second 
		semester, I found a church and they became my family away from home and they supported me when I needed it. I learned that sometimes 
		you need to take a step back, take a deep breath, and trust the Lord. I was happier and the homesickness began to fade. I have made 
		friends that will last a lifetime and I learned more about myself than I ever realized was possible. I couldn’t be more thankful for 
		the opportunity I have been given to go to Embry-Riddle and follow my dreams. Without God and the support of my friends and family, 
		I don’t think I would have ever made it this far.
