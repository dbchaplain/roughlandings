		<h3> Rough Landings Day 1: Release All Struggles </h3>

		The sea breeze blows the wisps of hair away from my face. Shinning down, the sun warms my skin and makes the ocean gleam. 
		I breathe in slowly, taking in the peacefulness of a calm day at the beach. A rush of tranquility made my worries recede. 
		To say my entire time spent at the beach was peaceful would be a lie. I went to the beach to meditate and relieve the 
		stresses of finding a job. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I’m literally accomplishing childhood dreams before I graduate college, and we’re not even talking about the stupid dreams 
		that go: “when I’m an adult I’m buying the flavor of ice cream I like.” We’re talking about interning at the organization 
		I’ve always wanted to work for, and even doing research that I fantasized about as a kid. Though, sometimes I feel I have 
		not accomplished anything, despite knowing I have accomplishments. I’m worried that employers will think I’m an imposter 
		or I’m not really qualified even with my hard work.

		<p>
		Of course, I know I have accomplishments because I have a few superb mentors to guide me about the things that go on resumes. 
		But, I came to the beach worried about finding a job. Looking out to the ocean, I breathed in and breathed out gradually. 
		Breathing in again, I knew that I had everything in me to succeed. I had released all struggles. Though I still felt fear, 
		the worry was gone. Graduating college and finding a job involves many changes and enormous growth. I gained what I needed in 
		going to beach: trust in myself through releasing the struggle.
