		<h3> Rough Landings Day 20: Psalms 46:5 </h3>
		
		
		<p> <b>
		“God is within her she will not fall.” <br>
		Psalms 46:5
		</b> </p>
		
		<p>
		In a world where everything is demanded on the spot and time seems to move at warp speed, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and unprepared, especially 
		in college. We all have to face those things we don’t want to do: that meaningless speech, preparing for that job interview, or pitching your best
		idea to a group that may not like it. Sometimes we psych ourselves out and as we get more nervous, we start to believe that we are not prepared for
		the task at hand. It’s times like these where we need to remember that we are not alone. When we stand up next to the podium ready to give that
		frightening speech, Jesus is there with us giving us the words we need to speak.
		</p>

		<p>
		I’ve had many experiences where I had to push past things that I didn’t want to do. “Get out of your comfort zone” they said. I wasn’t even in the same
		vicinity of my comfort zone. Needless to say, I’ve been so nervous sometimes that I wish I could quit. But everytime I think I should quit, Psalms 46:5 
		comes back to me. “God is within her she will not fall.” Psalms 46:5. And if God is with me and I cannot fall, then what is there to worry about? By 
		lifting the fear and worry to Him, we have none. We are free to proceed without hesitation that God has our back and he will not let us fail. With this 
		scripture in our minds, we can be reminded that we have no fear, as God has taken that fear and promised us safety instead.
		</p>
