		<h3> Rough Landings Day 13: Build Up Each Other </h3>

		<p> <b>
		“Therefore encourage one another and build up each other, as indeed you are doing.” <br>
		– 1 Thessalonians 5:11
		</b> </p>
		
		<p>
		Every student here knows that Embry-Riddle is a tough school–the higher expectations placed on us demand a level of effort that is shocking 
		for some, especially incoming Freshmen. I was one of those guys who came from my senior year in high school thinking college would be a 
		breeze: I couldn’t wait to be a fully “independent” college student. You can imagine the horror I felt when I sat down in my very first class
		to find that there was already homework due, which all my peers had dutifully completed and turned in online. I was worried, not only because
		I had missed my first assignment, but also because I was the only one in the class who didn’t turn it in. If I am being honest, I am not a 
		responsible student. If I am left to my own devices, I’ll inevitably convince myself that the exam tomorrow doesn’t really exist and take a 
		nap instead of studying. I wouldn’t have lasted half a semester here if it wasn’t for the study group that invited me to join them, or the
		people I’ve met who have been willing to help me succeed. Making social connections is beyond essential for all college students, not only 
		because you might end up knowing some of these people for the rest of your life, but also because every person needs some encouragement in 
		their life. Find that person (or people) that will push you to outdo your best effort, who can help you set goals for yourself and motivate 
		you to see them through. I wouldn’t be writing this if it wasn’t for all the people I’ve met in just one year on campus. Always look out for 
		your fellow classmates: reach out to those who are struggling, <b> encourage one another and build up each other</b>, because they would do the same 
		for you!
