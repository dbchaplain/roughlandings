	<h2> A note from the editor, Tarra Keating: </h2> 

		<p>
		<b>How do I use this? </b> <br>
		You can read a devotional every day for 40 days. You can skip around. You can only look when you need advice about a certain problem. 
		It is up to you. A selection of devotionals will be available every day from March 8th to April 16th.  All 40 devotionals will be available 
		after April 9th, 2017 and can be viewed whenever needed. Pick whatever works best for you! The point is to draw inspiration from how others
		have experienced similar struggles. You may be inspired by a daily read or it may be of more benefit to seek out stories that relate to what 
		you are currently going through.  The point is there are many ways, pick what works for you. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<b> How did this come to be? </b> <br>
		What’s a universal way for students to help others struggling with similar issues? What can we learn from people with different religious and 
		cultural differences from our own? How can we put something together for the Riddle students? <br>
		
		These were the questions that Reverend Keck and I wanted to answer when we first set out on this journey. Over time we came to a simple conclusion.
		A devotional. Devotionals are used in various religions to assist daily worship. They are typically structured with a quote, story, and a takeaway. 
		We decided since Riddle isn’t a typical school and we have a diverse culture we may have to go off the beaten path. Enclosed you will find everything 
		from the traditional structure, to poems, to art, to various types of self-expression. Just like Riddle, the devotional is diverse and draws from a 
		range of students with a range of backgrounds and coming from a range of emotional places. <br>

		A devotional is typically religious however some of the pieces have little tie to one religion, like the culture of Riddle. Each student chose what content
		and how they wanted to present it.  In this way the devotional is interfaith and allows students to experience new perspectives. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<b> Why 40? </b> <br>
		We landed on 40 because it ties significantly into Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. For the Jewish “the number 40 has great significance throughout the 
		Torah and the Talmud. The number 40 represents transition or change; the concept of renewal; a new beginning. The number 40 has the power to lift a spiritual 
		state [1]”. It is significant to the Muslims because the number is repeated various times such as when “Musa Alahi Salam traveled 40 years in the desert” and 
		“it is said that a person’s intellect attains maturity in forty years, everyone according to his own capacity [2]”. For similar reasons is has significance to 
		Christianity. It is “[mentioned] 146 times in Scripture [it] generally symbolizes a period of testing, trial or probation. During Moses’s life he lived forty 
		years in Egypt and forty years in the desert before God selected him to lead his people out of slavery [3]”. While this devotional is open to the entire 
		spectrum of religion we thought the significance of 40 days was unavoidable and broad enough for everyone to relate.  <br>
