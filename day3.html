		<b>Maybe you know what I’m on about </b> <br>
		<i> a poem about fading </i> <br> <br>

			I wish I could tell you <br>
			it was like fading into the sky <br>
			the way clouds do on a cold day <br>
			lightening into transparency <br>
			wispy bit by wispy bit <br>
			like a smudge removing itself from a <br>
			cerulean wall <br>
			turned sideways <br>
			I wish I could tell you <br> 
			it was like the sun <br>
			on a really bright day <br>
			so bright the white <br>
			hot light <br>
			becomes the sky <br>
			and the sky becomes the sea in which you swim <br>
			and breathe <br>
			I wish I could tell you <br>
			there was still a silver lining <br>
			outlining <br>
			your form <br>
			when it was over <br>
			But that’s not how it is <br>
			at all <br>
			It’s more like a black hole <br>
			lots of black holes <br>
			sprinkled through your soul <br>
			eating up your space <br>
			the stars and the planets <br>
			the delicate, diaphanous nebulae <br>
			forming new yous and future yous <br>
			and eternal, beautiful potential yous <br>
			the yous that could be <br>
			being <br>
			gobbled up by <br>
			heavy <br>
			massive <br>
			moments <br>
			swallowing whole solar systems <br>
			and galaxies <br>
			vanishing <br>
			from the inside of you <br>
			out <br>
			as you <br>
			try to grip the sliding <br>
			dark matter <br>
			the gravity flux <br>
			the warping reality <br>
			bending and blurring <br>
			and contorting your edges <br>
			until you can’t see them  <br>
			at all <br>
			until you’re nothing <br>
			but a figment <br> 
			of your imagination <br> 
			a “was” instead of an “is” <br>
			chasing after the racing <br>
			leaving <br>
			light <br>
			holding onto anything beautiful <br>
			hoping  <br>
			it will anchor you
