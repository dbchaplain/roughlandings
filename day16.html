		<h3> Rough Landings Day 16: A Father’s Words </h3>
		
		
		<p>
		I finished my high school in 2013 in the United Arab Emirates. I moved to Florida to study Mechanical Engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. I would say that was a huge
		step, and I never thought I could make it one day and study abroad. During my first semester, I always thought that I was going to fail my classes because I believed that university 
		classes are harder and require more responsibilities from students to do well than high school classes.
		</p> 
		
		<p>
		One day, I called my father, and I told him about my feeling and thoughts about how I was afraid of failing my classes and not doing well. He said,
		
		<blockquote>  <i>
		If you are an active person, people love to be around you. You are a good person, and you look for solutions. Throughout the day, you are surrounded with anxieties, 
		like thinking about failing your classes and all these anxieties add up overtime and kill your optimism. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said, “Allah the Exalted says: 
		‘I am as my slave expects me to be, and I am with him when he remembers Me. If he remembers Me inwardly, I will remember him inwardly, and if he remembers Me in an assembly,
		I will remember him in a better assembly (i.e., in the assembly of angels)’’’ (Sunnah Book 18, Hadeeth 28). So I would like you, son, to be an optimist about your educational 
		life and remember Allah everywhere.
		</i> </blockquote> 

		After that call, I was no longer a pessimist, and I am graduating next semester with an outstanding GPA.
