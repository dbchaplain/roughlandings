		<h3> Rough Landings Day 12: Meeting New People </h3>

		Meeting new people with a different upbringing and way of living is always difficult, and for me this was more so true early during 
		my experience as a freshman here at Embry-Riddle.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Arriving at Embry-Riddle as a freshman from Africa was both an exciting and scary experience. Waking up in this new place, with new 
		people, and with new ways of doing things all weighed heavy. During orientation I was hesitant to go to any of the events put together 
		because I felt like I was different and didn’t have anything in common with the other freshmen. I didn’t want to have to explain why I 
		“couldn’t eat pork” or “had to pray 5 times a day” so I just avoided them all and kept to myself. This lead to me missing so many important 
		and interesting experiences that would have been beneficial to me as a freshman.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		After a significant period of dealing with this issue I came across an ayah (verse) in the Quran that gave me a different perspective on 
		the issue. It says, “O mankind! Lo! We have created you male and female, and have made you nations and tribes that ye may know one another” 
		(49:13).
		</p>
		
		<p>
		It allowed me to understand that differences in religion, culture or upbringing shouldn't be a barrier to interacting with others, but rather
		it presents an opportunity to learn more about those people and in turn learn more about the world so we can better embrace its diversity.
		</p>

		<p>
		You're always going to meet people that are different from you, and avoiding them or refusing to interact with them only further emphasizes
		the differences that are present. A more rewarding solution is getting to know such people and reaching an understanding about how truly 
		similar we all are, regardless of where we come from or what we believe. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		So don’t be afraid, go out there and meet different people, because in diversity lies our true strength.
