		Finals week Fall 2016 was by far one of the hardest weeks of my life. Over the course of 6 days, I had Physics and Turbines 
		finals, 6 other "final" exams, as well as a final Technical Report Writing paper due. Also in that mix was my flight training 
		which was every other day. I was up late studying for exams most of the time so I didn't really get much sleep that week. I 
		remember periodically freaking about how much I had to do in so little time. Over this period, I was constantly thinking of
		my favorite Bible verse, Matthew 6:34- "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day
		has enough trouble of its own." This has always been my favorite verse because it just reminds me that it's going to be okay. 
		Just take it one day at a time and with God's help, you will get through whatever you're going through in life.
