		“[I]t is important to remember that one of the central ideas of FSMism [Flying Spaghetti Monsterism] is the idea of inclusion. Anyone can be a member, 
		no matter their age, race, background, or even their religious affiliation. As we've stated earlier, we do not base our beliefs on dogma—if we did, 
		we'd have to think that we're absolutely right about everything. . . . We simply deliver His Word and let the people decide.”- Gospel of the Flying 
		Spaghetti Monster, p. 93

		Leaving my very strict Southern Baptist home in a very rural Southern town to go to college was a tremendous culture shock for me. Seventeen years old 
		and tossed in a sea of people, most of whom were the same gender as I but with whom I had nothing else in common was a shock akin to going skiing in Aspen
		over Spring Break from sunny, wonderful Daytona Beach. Within the tremendously long span of three days I managed to completely alienate my roommate and 
		everyone else on the hall in housing with my lack of understanding of or awareness of things outside of my shell of knowledge and, I’m certain, convince 
		all my professors that I was an irrecoverable idiot.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		By Sunday, I was desperate for affirmation of my existence and importance, and so I went to the one place that had been the center of my life for the seventeen 
		years previous—the Church. With my parents, I had joyfully spent Sundays and Wednesdays in the fourth pew on the right hand side of the altar my entire life.
		It was home. So, that first Sunday, I went to the closest I went to the closest Southern Baptist Church I could find that first Sunday of College with a sense 
		of relief and longing and homecoming.
		</p> 
		
		<p>
		It was not my home. As I sat on the bench (the building was too new to call them pews), and sang out of a different hymnal than the one I used (and they only 
		sang the first, third, and fourth verses of Amazing Grace, as opposed to all six as it should be), I felt set out to sea, a ship with its anchor cut. There 
		was no welcoming comfort here. The minister spoke, but it was not the Truth of God as I had been taught my entire life. I left and returned to the College I 
		had been looking forward to attending, completely alone and set apart in the world, no longer a true part even of that one central component of my life. 
		Perhaps more desperately than my emotional angst, I was hungry. In the darkness of my despair, and the growling of my stomach, I saw a sign on the bulletin
		board: “Free food! Learn about His Noodly Appendage!”
		</p> 
		
		<p>
		As all participants in a College community know, the advertisement had me at “free” and had me forever at “food”. So I went, not knowing or caring what his 
		noodly appendage might be. What I learned there changed my life. “What do we stand for?” “All that is good.” “What are we against?” “All that isn’t good.” 
		The Hell of my childhood religion was replaced with the hope of a Heaven featuring a Stripper Factory and a giant Beer Volcano; the strictness and rigidity 
		of dress code of my childhood faith was replaced with the requirement to wear full Pirate regalia. Sunday sermons (and fried chicken brought by elderly
		individuals who pinched my cheeks and commented on my height weekly) were replaced by Friday night Ramen in my dorm room while I studied and finished the work,
		so that my Professors would no longer be convinced of my irrecoverable idiocy.
		</p> 
		
		<p> 
		This year, the sacred month of my faith will carry a special meaning; for a few days, I will eat Ramen noodles in commemoration of my days as a starving college 
		student, which are rapidly coming to an end. I will strive to be happy about what I have accomplished, and at least be happy that I am truly a Pastafarian. And, 
		at the end, I will give back of my Ramen to the community, in the hopes that some struggling first-year, ripped from their moorings by being plunged into the
		wealth of novelty in the world, will have the comfort of His Noodly Appendage with them in the depths of their despair and know that it is not about what others 
		think of them, or about where they belong in the world, but simply about “All that is Good”.
