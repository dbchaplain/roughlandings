		<h3> Rough Landings Day 19 </h3>
		
		
		<p> 
		I came to Embry-Riddle surrounded by uncertainty. I was trying to get good grades, become stronger physically and earn an Marine Officer ROTC scholarship. 
		My family was falling apart back home and I was their person to vent to. My girlfriend of three years left me (which could be a book). I was the most 
		depressed and stressed that I had ever been in my 19 years of life up to that point. I went through the year constantly pushing myself just to get through 
		the day. Eventually things started to fall back into place. My girlfriend came back to me, I made the deans list, and after time, suffering, and devotion
		I earned the ROTC scholarship that first motivated me to come to this university.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Right when I thought everything was ok I was medically disqualified from the United States Marine Corp. After the pain, suffering, time, sleep-deprivation, 
		passion, love and energy I put into that scholarship it was all stripped away because I have a mild allergic reaction to cashews. I was beyond devastated 
		and I didn’t know what to do. My childhood plan for the future was gone. I began working 70 hours a week between two jobs, stopped exersicing and barely ate.
		I lost 25lbs in just over three weeks.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		On a whim I made a phone call to a family friend who was a Lieutent Colonial in the Marine Corps. He gave me advice about how to get the scholarship back 
		and I went with it.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		After three weeks and a couple of vague conversations with a doctor I was able to convice the Marine Corps to give me my scholarship back. It was one of 
		the happiest days of my life.
		</p> 
		
		<p>
		When I called the Lieutent Colonial to tell him he said “Im happy for you, but what did you learn?” I replied with something not that serious because I
		didn’t know what else to say. He came back with eight words that were simple and rather overused but it is something that means the world to me now. “No,
		if there's a will, there’s a way.”
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Now, whenever something seems impossible or out of reach, I just remind myself of those words and live by them. If you have to get somewhere and have the 
		tenacity to push, you can achieve anything. Except when it comes to beating the Riddle run-around. You’re screwed either way.
