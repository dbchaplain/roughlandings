		<h3> Rough Landings Day 10 </h3>
		
		
		<p>
		A coward believes he will ever live <br> 
		if he keep him safe from strife: <br> 
		but old age leaves him not long in peace <br> 
		though spears may spare his life
		</p>

		~Hávamál (“Sayings of the High One”), 16
		</b> </p> 
		
		<p>
		Upon entering Embry-Riddle, I lost contact with most of my friends from back home. I didn’t know who to talk to, 
		who to hang out with, or essentially how to vent my frustrations or express my joy. My heart was absent in anything
		I did, from school studies to video games. To say the minimum, I had a lot of difficulties in making new friends here. 
		I was anxious and nervous to approach either people or clubs and organizations, but I eventually mustered the courage 
		to join one. After I joined one, my grades actually improved, and my social life breathed a new life. It was like an 
		unending storm of loneliness was swept away, and I could grow once more. Even if there isn’t a club that you want to 
		join, you need to find friends with the same interests and hobbies. Make a club, if all else fails. Nothing can help 
		you so much as a good friend, the more the merrier.
