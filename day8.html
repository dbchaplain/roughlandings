			“Go out and do something. It isn’t your room that’s a prison, it’s yourself.” <br>
			- Sylvia Plath </b>
			</p>

			<p>
			A place between two thoughts, <br>
			An unusual case of vagueness of vocation, <br>
			Another blinded soul upon the road. 
			</p>

			<p>
			Uncertainty; <br>
			An oddity among the many sure-footed peers, <br>
			I am uncertain of what purpose to pursue.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I was once told to go out, <br>
			Find something that I enjoyed <br>
			And if I could make money doing it <br> 
			I had hit the jackpot. 
			</p> 
			
			<p>
			Purpose; <br>
			What do you like, what do you enjoy, <br>
			And what brings you dismay that you must avoid? 
			</p> 
			
			<p>
			I am getting the sense that it may not be up to me. <br>
			Too grand a scheme I am looking to find <br>
			In the little moments of the day to day <br>
			That make up a lifetime.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Look outside yourself <br>
			Towards someone else’s need, <br>
			And then you’ll start to see.
			</p>
