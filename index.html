		<i> <b> This is the story of how Embry-Riddle students are using tough times in their life to help others. </i> </b>
		The college life occasionally proves to be struggling. In this devotional, students help other
		students by offering their stories and insights of challenges faced in college. This devotional, 
		explicityly interfaith and non-sectarian, showcases students exploring how their beliefs, 
		practices, ethics, philosophy, etc. has helped them to overcome a "rough landing."
