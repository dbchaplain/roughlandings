	<h3> Interfaith. For the students, by the students. Just for you. </h3> 
	
	<p>
		The college life occasionally proves to be struggling. In this devotional, students help other
		students by offering their stories and insights of challenges faced in college. This devotional, 
		explicityly interfaith and non-sectarian, showcases students exploring how their beliefs, 
		practices, ethics, philosophy, etc. has helped them to overcome a "rough landing."
